## 2) About

This is a hobby project to learn python.

The code grabs the major ISU figure skating events
from the official website.

The event list will be striped from all junior events
and sorted by date of the current season.
Finally two text files will be written.

One is an event txt file with all the relevant dates
of the season.
The 2nd file is an error log. If a month returns no results
it will list these month in the log for reference and debugging.

Since it's a hobby project i try to expand and maintain the code but its
not a top priority. So it might become deprecated as
soon as the website changes.

Feel free to post code improvements and feature request via github.
